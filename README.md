# deepLearningWithSmallDatasets
lean how to train small Datasets with CNN of deep learning
# Training Options
1. Data augmentation: it is a method of generating more training data from existing training samples. 
2. Use pre-trained network:it is generally pre-trained and stored networks of large data sets for large-scale image classification problems.

  * Feature extraction with pre-trained network
  * Fine tune your pre-trained network
